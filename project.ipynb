    "# IMPROVE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE FOR EMIRATES AIRLINE TO INCREASE  PROFITS \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Customer Experience is the sum of all the interactions a customer has with a business and its products or services. It is the customer's perception of a company. In the airline industry, you need to be on top of your game if you want recurrent customers. Emirates is one of the airlines with an average rating of 6/10. From 2010, the rating for the service hasnâ€™t changed much. Improving the customer experience would certainly increase their ratings. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, changing things would mean restructuring their business strategy.The aim of this project is to provide a model which they can use to improve their customer experience without changing too much.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset \n",
    "The data was scraped from airlinequality.com by quankiquanki from Skytrax website: https://github.com/quankiquanki/skytrax-reviews-dataset. Skytrax is probably the best site for customers reviews from the airline industry, where it collects reviews and ratings for each airlines, lounges, seats and airports. Special thanks to reddit user jo698 for recommending this.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used here had a total sample of 691 observations(Emirates only) with 20 columns containing info of the reviewers. The ratings for each attribute ranges from 1 to 5, while the overall rating is from 1-10. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach\n",
    "* First, I built a model that can predict the overall rating based on each feature's rating. In order to do that, I conduct OLS Linear model, Ridge linear for parameter regularization and random forest. \n",
    "* Then, I select the best model among these methods and choose the important features for airlines.\n",
    "* Finally, using these features on the best models, I create a table for relative reference in planning targets for attribute ratings. This table together with the selected best model and cost-benefit analysis, Emirates airlines can build a good strategy on where to invest their resources to achieve better performance in customer satisfaction and profits.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Result\n",
    "* Random forest is the best performance with the lowest MSE of 1.64 on the test set. The most important factors in order that may affect overall rating are value-money rating, cabin staff, seat comfort, food beverages and inflight entertainment. These all have positive correlations with overall rating.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendations \n",
    "* Based on its corporate strategy and cost-benefit analysis, Emirates may use the reference table and Random forest model to plan their target for improvement in some services.\n",
    "* While pricing is related closely with business strategy and positioning, Emirates might find it easier to improve its cabin staff and food beverages while still have huge effect on overall rating.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Improvements I can make\n",
    "Do topic and sentiment analysis on the travellers' reviews for Emirates airline to see which topics are most discussed, and alerts on negative reviews to take in-time action.\n"
